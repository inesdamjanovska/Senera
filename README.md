# Senera


Senera is a web-based app that helps users generate stylish outfits using their own clothes. Users upload images of clothing items they own (or want to buy), and the system stores, tags, and organizes them. Later, based on prompts like occasion, weather, or style, the app intelligently selects relevant clothing items and generates a virtual outfit image using OpenAI's image API.
